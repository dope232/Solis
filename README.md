Solis, Tax prediction website made during first sem of college, using python, and it's libraries such as streamlit, pyrebase, PIL and pandas. 
Integrated database and python frontend/GUI(Streamlit) using Google Firebase, however, the test database expires in 30 days, so it can't be used after Feb 17. Will update the database settings during my freetime.
